                 <p>In a class of 30 students, the average marks scored in mathematics is 60%. One student\r\n                      scored 70%. Has this particular student fared better at mathematics than class average?\r\n      The answer is a simple yes. The 10% gap in simple terms is alpha.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Alpha is a tool to calculate investment progress in comparison to a benchmark like an\r\n                        index. A positive alpha of 1.0 translates into the fund’s outperformance over its\r\n      benchmark index by 1%. A negative alpha of 1.0 indicates underperformance of 1%. <br />\r\n                        Alpha= R – Rf – beta (Rm-Rf)<br />\r\n                        Alpha as per the above formula can explained as Portfolio Return minus the Risk free\r\n                        rate of return minus Beta (measure of volatility of returns in a portfolio) multiplied\r\n                        by Benchmark return minus Risk free rate of return.\r\n                        For example, assuming that the actual return of the fund is 30, the risk-free rate is\r\n      8%, beta is 1.1, and the benchmark index return is 20%, alpha is calculated as:<br />\r\n                        Alpha = (0.30-0.08) – 1.1 (0.20-0.08) = 0. 088 or 8.8%<br />\r\n                        The above reflects the investment’s outperformance over its benchmark index by 8.8%.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <span class=\"anchor\" id=\"amc\"></span>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h3>AMC</h3>\r\n                    <p> AMC - 'Asset Management Company’. As the name suggest it is a company that is\r\n      responsible for managing the assets purchased using one’s investment funds. </p>\r\n                    <p>AMC is a company that decides to invest funds pooled by clients into different types of\r\n                      securities as per stated objectives, thereby providing clients more diversification and\r\n      investment options. AMCs earn income by charging service fees to clients. </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"aum\" className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h3>AUM</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        AUM – ‘Assets Under Management’<br />\r\n                        AUM is the total market value of investments managed by AMCs. <br />\r\n                        Why is it relevant? AMC’s charge fund management fees on the assets managed by them.\r\n                        Thus higher the AUM implies higher is the fees earned by the AMC.\r\n    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <span class=\"anchor\" id=\"beta\"></span>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h3>Beta</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        We all would clearly enjoy higher returns or alpha. However there is no free lunch.\r\n                        Higher returns may also be accompanied with higher risk. Just like alpha measures the\r\n                        return of one’s funds compared to an index, Beta measures the volatility of returns or\r\n                        risk in a portfolio compared to the entire market. Stock with a higher beta has greater\r\n      risk. It is translated as below: <br />\r\n                        If Beta is 1, then the risk of portfolio is exactly as per the market. So, if Sensex or\r\n                        Nifty go up by 5%, the portfolio value would go up by 5%. If Sensex or Nifty fall by 2%,\r\n                        the portfolio value is expected to fall by 2%.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <p>If Beta is higher than 1, then the portfolio is more volatile than the market. Example if\r\n                      Beta is 2, if Sensex or Nifty go up by 5%, the portfolio value would go up by 10%, if\r\n      Sensex or Nifty fall by 2%, the portfolio value is expected to fall by 4%.</p>\r\n                    <p>If Beta is lesser than 1, then the portfolio is less volatile than the market. Example if\r\n                      Beta is 0.5, if Sensex or Nifty go up by 5%, the portfolio value would go up by 2.5%, if\r\n      Sensex or Nifty fall by 2%, the portfolio value is expected to fall by 1%.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        If Beta is zero, then the portfolio is uncorrelated to the market<br />\r\n                        If Beta is less than zero, then the portfolio is negatively uncorrelated to the market\r\n    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <span class=\"anchor\" id=\"benchmark\"></span>\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h3>Benchmark</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Student A has scored 95% in mathematics. How does that compare to another student B who\r\n                        has scored 90% in a literature subject. Difficult to compare right? But if the remaining\r\n                        students have all scored 100% in mathematics then one knows that the student A has not\r\n                        fared well in mathematics.\r\n      A benchmark is a standard used against which mutual fund performance is measured. <br />\r\n                        Hence a Pharma fund’s performance would need to be compared to a benchmark made of\r\n                        pharma companies e.g. Nifty Pharma index.\r\n    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <span class=\"anchor\" id=\"capital_gain\"></span>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h3>Capital Gain</h3>\r\n                    <p>One has being investing Rs 10,000/- in a balanced <a href=\"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/investment\" title=\"Mutual Fund\">mutual funds</a>\r\n                        every month to save for a car.

Alternatively, your debt fund may have taken\r\n                            too much risk on low quality debt without the associated benefit of outperforming\r\n                            the benchmark. If your equity mutual fund is yielding lower than an index fund, then\r\n                            you are actually earning negative yields on your market risk. That does not make\r\n                            sense. There are occasions when the fund returns have been too volatile which again\r\n                            defeats the purpose of MF investing.\r\n                            These are cases you must look to exit and reinvest in alternate funds.\r\n      </p>\r\n                        <h3>Past performance</h3>\r\n                        <p>Investors should avoid investing by evaluating only the latest performance of a\r\n                          mutual fund.

You would have heard it said that the best time to enter the market is\r\n                        when it has hit rock bottom – buy low, sell high. This is called timing the market.

Further, you may not have a huge lumpsum amount at hand to\r\n                        invest and take advantage of such an opportunity. Further, since you will be investing\r\n                        in a funds, and not piecemeal stocks, all the stocks that make up the fund will never be\r\n                        at the rock bottom together – and if they are, then the fund is not diversified enough\r\n                        anyways,\r\n                        and you may want to reconsider investing in it.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        An alternative that suits most investors is known as systematic investment plan or SIP.\r\n                        SIP involves making fixed, periodic investment into the mutual fund of your choice.\r\n                        Typically, the periodicity is once a month, but you can choose to invest once per\r\n                        quarter, or even per fortnight or per week. Doing this ensures that your buying price is\r\n                        averaged over a long period – and therefore, you do not have to worry about timing the\r\n                        market or think about whether the market is bearish or bullish.\r\n                        As the amount to be invested every period is fixed, SIP ensures that you purchase more\r\n                        units when the market is down and NAV is lower than average, and lesser units when\r\n                        market is bullish and NAV is higher than average. Over the long-term, this ensures that\r\n                        the average cost per unit remains low.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Further, the <a href=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitpl-mf-designs/hari/MFBlog/SIP-or-systematic-investment-plan.html\" title=\"Advantage of SIP\">advantage of SIP </a> is that you do not have to make a\r\n                        large investment at one go.

Remember that you need to meet your day to day expenses without\r\n                          having to dip into the investment that you are making – and this is only possible if\r\n                          you have a stable source of income. Note that you need only worry about your income\r\n                          being stable – not high. No income is too low to invest. In fact, many a young\r\n                          people make the mistake of not making investments early in their career believing\r\n                          they will do so when they have a higher disposable income. This is a wrong approach!\r\n                          You should invest at least 10% of your monthly income, regardless of how large your\r\n                          income is and plan to meet all your other expenses with the rest of your income. Cut\r\n                          down on your expenses today, rather than on your investments.

Your risk appetite also depends on how what the\r\n                            rest of your portfolio looks like. For example, if all your other investments are in\r\n                            the F&amp;O space, you should look for low-risk mutual funds that are virtually loss\r\n                            free and guarantee a safe return. On the other hand, if you are already invested in\r\n                            instruments like PPF and fixed deposits, you can choose to invest in high-risk,\r\n                            high0return funds that aim to maximize returns over a short period.\r\n      </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"part\">\r\n                        <h3>Goals</h3>\r\n                        <p>Before you make your investments, you have to be clear on what your goals are. Unless\r\n                          you know why you are making an investment, you will not be able to decide where the\r\n                          investment should be, and when you should exit. For example, if you are aiming to\r\n                          build a retirement fund with your retirement close to 20 years away, you can choose\r\n                          mutual funds with a long-term horizon and with focus on FDs and other safe\r\n                          instruments. On the other hand, if you are looking to save money for a car that you\r\n                          will like to buy 5 years down the line – a shorter term horizon with focus on equity\r\n        with strong fundamentals may be a better choice. </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"part\">\r\n                        <h3>Stage in life (Single/Married etc)</h3>\r\n                        <p>Stage in life that you are in has a direct impact on both your risk appetite and\r\n                          goals. As pointed out earlier, someone who is still single and just starting out his\r\n                          career can take higher risks than someone with a child and already approaching\r\n                          mid-life. Life-stage could also decide the time horizon you can work with. For\r\n                          example, if you have a child today – you have about 16 years to build a corpus for\r\n                          his higher education. You may also want to save monies for your child’s wedding that\r\n                          may take place about 25 years from now. The 9 to 10 year difference in these two\r\n                          events means that you can choose to make different kinds of investment choices for\r\n                          each of these. On the other hand, an emergency fund needs to be available as soon as\r\n                          possible and you need to make sure that the investments that you make for such a\r\n        fund remains liquid so as you can turn it into cash on very short notice. </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"part\">\r\n                        <h3>Planning for tax savings </h3>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            None of us want to pay more tax than strictly required.

I have stated the most important ones below:</p>\r\n                    <p><strong>Retirement planning –</strong></p>\r\n                    <p>Let us assume there are two investor, A &amp; B. They start working at the age of 20. </p>\r\n                    <p>Investor A starts investing Rs. 1000/- per month right from the start of his career for the next 10 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 1,20,000/-. He leaves the investment in the market for next 30years, until he is 60 years old.</p>\r\n                    <p>Investor B starts investing after initial 10 years of his career. But to build a nest he starts investing Rs.1000/- per month for the next 30 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 3,60,000/-. </p>\r\n                    <p>Assuming a market return of 8% p.a., who do you think would have a larger retirement fund at the age of 60.</p>\r\n                    <p>Investor A has contributed a lot less than Investor B, but due to the power of compounding, Investor A has a retirement nest of Rs. 20,13,000/- whereas Investor B has managed to accumulate a wealth of Rs. 15,00,000/-.</p>\r\n                    <p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\r\n                    <p><strong>Children’s Education – </strong></p>\r\n                    <p>“Education is the key to unlocking the world, a passport to freedom” – Oprah Winfrey.</p>\r\n                    <p>Every parent wants the best for their children and rightfully so. Education has always held a special significance in our lives and we always believed that good education is the key to success and don’t we all want our kids to be more successful that ourselves.</p>\r\n                    <p>Thankfully to achieve our goal, today we have multiple options in the field of education that we can provide to our children. However, these options are expensive. </p>\r\n                    <p>So, what can help us provide for our kids college enrolment?</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        We need to plan through a multiple step process:\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li>Calculate the time horizon, the time remaining to enrol the child for graduate or post graduate course.</li>\r\n                        <li>Estimate the cost of education – the future cost not the current cost. Many people forget to factor in the evils of inflation while estimating the future cost of education. If the current cost of a post graduate course is Rs, 5,00,000/- and your child will be eligible for that course in 10 years time, then assuming an inflation rate of 5%, the likely cost of the course in 10 years would be Rs 8,14,447/-. So, we would need to provide for Rs 8,14,000/-.</li>\r\n                        <li>Once we know the cost of education, we need to determine how much we need to save monthly to achieve this goal. The earlier we start the lower the amount required to the saved per month. In the above example, investing Rs 3000 per month for 10 years would help one create a corpus of around Rs 8.4 lakhs at a CAGR of 15%.</li>\r\n                    </ol><br />\r\n                    <p> What kind of funds are suitable for retirement planning and children education goals?</p>\r\n                    <p>To start with, both retirement and children’s education, need to planned much in advance. Since the time frame for these goals is minimum 8-10 years, you can invest in equity funds. One can start by investing aggressive small cap and large cap equity funds. These funds have higher exposure to equity and hence could have volatile returns. However over a longer period of time, these funds also provide higher returns. </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    </p><ol>\r\n                        <li>1. Large Cap Funds invest in large-cap companies. The stock prices of these companies are considerably stable compared to overall market. </li>\r\n                        <li>2. Small-Cap Fund is extremely vulnerable to market ups and downs and carry higher risk. However, the reward for choosing higher risk is the attractive returns. </li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <p />\r\n                    <p>As we get closer to the college enrolment date or retirement age, we should start allocating some funds out of these small cap and large cap equity funds into balanced funds to reduce volatility towards the end. A strategy that gradually grows more conservative over time requires that us regularly rebalance the portfolio and ease up on your stock weighting as you get closer to our goal.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"medium_term_goals\" className=\"pb-5 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <hgroup>\r\n                        <h4> <strong>Medium Term Goals</strong> </h4>\r\n                    </hgroup>\r\n                    <p>One could ask, why do one need mutual funds for buying a house? That’s what mortgage loans are for. Well the loan to value ratio for mortgages is max of 75% for any home loan above Rs 75,00,000/. So, one needs to provide a substantial amount for down payment. Plus we have stamp duties and registration charges to be covered. This may require a lump sum amount which may need to be planned 4-6years in advance.</p>\r\n                    <p>Another medium-term goal could a self owned car which we may have set our eyes on when we started working at the age of 20 with a target of buying the same before we reach 25 years of age. Such goals need same financial planning and regular savings which need to be invested to generate returns.</p>\r\n                    <p>To achieve such medium term goals, you can take calculated risks by making investments in a balanced fund. When one opts for a balanced fund, their money gets invested in debt and equity instruments together.  The debt portion works as a cushion and covers the impact if the equity portion is unable to reap great rewards. However, a combination of debt and equity largely increases the investor’s chances of reaping attractive returns with just a fair percentage of risk.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"short_term_goals\" className=\"pb-5\">\r\n                    <hgroup>\r\n                        <h4> <strong>Short Term Goals</strong> </h4>\r\n                    </hgroup>\r\n                    <p>While investing for longer term you are looking for capital appreciation and hence can take risk volatility of returns on your capital in near term but if the investment horizon is short term then the objective is more about safety over growth. You also need to ensure liquidity of your investment at the right time also matters when it comes to investing for short term goal or emergency fund.</p>\r\n                    <p>While considering investment avenues for short term goals typically traditional instruments like fixed deposit pop up. Bank fixed deposit have been the first choice so long primarily because it does not fluctuate your capital. However taxation (TDS is deducted on deposit interest) and cost of liquidating them before maturity gives a bigger blow when short term investments are considered. </p>\r\n                    <p>Mutual funds have various categories of schemes that cater to short term investments which can help you in meeting your short term goals like planning for holidays or wedding or buying electronic gadgets or house renovation to name a few. These are goals with typically 1-3 target date.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Here too, the goal can impact the choice of short-term funds:\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li>For very short-term goals and for emergency fund you have to invest in liquid funds or ultra-short-term funds as emergency fund is a corpus which you may need immediately as and when emergency arises and hence liquidity and minimal exit load are critical drivers. These are funds that invest primarily into money market or short tenure liquid instruments but provide the flexibility to redeem the funds at short notice with minimal or no exit load.</li>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            If your goal is 3 years away, you can invest in an income fund or dynamic bond fund. These funds typically invest in corporate paper and are able to generate higher returns than bank fixed deposits in most cases.<br />\r\n                            Most importantly, unlike fixed deposits, no TDS is deducted on the interests earned in case of a Short-Term Debt Fund. Further Investors enjoy an indexation benefit when they invest in Debt Funds for a period exceeding 3 years. So even if the gross return is the same as Fixed deposits, these funds can provide higher post tax return depending upon the investors tax bracket.\r\n      </li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <p />\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"goal_of_tax_saving\" className=\"pb-5\">\r\n                    <hgroup>\r\n                        <h4 className=\"mb-3\"> <strong>Goal of Tax Saving</strong> </h4>\r\n                    </hgroup>\r\n                    <p>As mentioned earlier, we need to start investing to achieve short term, medium term and long term goals simultaneously. The obvious question would be how is it achievable? Hence we feel the pressure to prioritize and for most of us retirement saving is typically the most ignored goal in our scheme of things as it appears distant and one does not feel a pressing urge to address it. </p>\r\n                    <p>However, our desire to save tax every year can be channelled to help us achieve two goals with one investment: tax saving and investing for retirement. </p>\r\n                    <p>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) has turned out to be a popular tax saving and wealth creating instrument. While being an equity diversified fund, ELSS is riskier than the fixed-income-products   available for tax-saving, ELSS has the shortest lock in and offers the potential of growth via equity. Thus, we can start to save for retirement by considering ELSS to achieve this as well as save tax under section 80C. </p>\r\n                    <p>ELSS has a lock in of 3 years from the date of investment post which the scheme turns open ended. Rather than redeeming, it makes sense for the fund to be invested to meet a pre-decided goal.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"goal_of_regular_income\" className=\"pb-5\">\r\n                    <hgroup>\r\n                        <h4 className=\"mb-3\"> <strong>Goal of Regular Income</strong> </h4>\r\n                    </hgroup>\r\n                    <p>We have discussed about starting early to build a retirement pool but have not discussed what does one do once we actually retire.

Before understanding how Mutual Funds\r\n                      take advantage of market volatility, let us understand the concept of market volatility.\r\n                      Volatility is the quantum of change a security’s price goes through during a given\r\n                      period of time. The change would be positive or negative depending on whether markets go\r\n      up or down respectively.</p>\r\n                    <p>When share prices fall, the mutual fund will purchase more units of shares. Individual\r\n                      investors keep waiting for the bottom and sometimes miss out on purchasing shares at\r\n                      mouth watering prices. However, through a regular SIP, investing regularly in mutual\r\n                      funds helps investors take advantage of rupee cost averaging – which means cost of\r\n                      purchasing units averages out over a longer period of time and reduces impact of\r\n                      short-term volatility on one’s investment. In simpler words, volatility ensures that\r\n                      there are opportunities for the mutual fund portfolio manager to buy units at cheaper\r\n      prices which bumps up the return on investment over a longer period of time.</p>\r\n                    <p>Warren Buffet often quotes that over the long term, there's only one direction the market\r\n                      will go. BSE Sensex has given a compounded annual growth rate of 16% since 1979 till\r\n                      December 2017. Not to forget the biggest crashes like Harshad Mehta scandal in 1992 and\r\n                      the global financial crisis in 2008. The bottom-line is that even the worst crashes are\r\n                      rather resilient to long-term returns. A correction or a crash may not necessarily be a\r\n      negative thing for a long term investor. </p>\r\n                    <p>Prudent investors would avoid herd mentality. A common reason why investors are unhappy\r\n                      is when they see the stock market rising, they see many people booking profits. They\r\n                      also get greedy and cash in. Similarly, when there is crash, the same investors believe\r\n                      that it is a wise decision to sell and cut losses. Thus investors buy high and sell low,\r\n                      which negates the primary goal of investing. Hence, the most important quality for a\r\n                      long term investor is temperament and not intellect.

Inflation is a silent thief. When the\r\n                      government publishes the rate of inflation @ 6%, this implies that the average cost of\r\n                      living for us has gone up by 6%. If we had to spend Rs. 100/- a month until last year,\r\n                      then we would spend Rs. 106/- a month this year. This implies keeping money stashed in\r\n                      lockers also looses value due to inflation as it is worth less today compared to last\r\n                      year when considered based on the goods or luxuries the same money can buy for us. This\r\n                      is typically the reason why our retirement pool more often than not seems insufficient\r\n      at a later stage as people underestimate the impact of inflation.</p>\r\n                    <p>What we need is an investment that provides a return higher than inflation rate so that\r\n                      our savings do not lose value over time. Example: If bank FDs give us 6% rate of\r\n                      interest, then Rs. 100/- invested last year would be worth Rs. 106/- today. This will\r\n                      allow us to buy the same set of goods that we could have purchased last year for Rs.\r\n      100/-. </p>\r\n                    <p>But this is assuming there is no tax deducted at source as it would reduce our net\r\n                      return. Banks charge a TDS of 10% on the interest accrued if it is more than Rs 10,000\r\n      in a year.</p>\r\n                    <p>Equity mutual funds, however, do provide an opportunity to generate inflation beating\r\n                      returns.

We have work on it. Let\r\n                            us take the example of goal-based investing. A newbie investor may start a small SIP\r\n                            to\r\n                            invest a certain amount over 5 years to achieve a goal. However, after 18 months,\r\n                            this individual may be tempted to buy a new laptop and would be falling short of\r\n                            some amount.

Therefore it is critical to adhere to\r\n                            financial discipline when it comes to investing. Starting small makes it easier to\r\n                            get used to this. It is worth creating a habit of putting aside a small amount. Over\r\n                            a period of time, this would make it easier to deal with following a discipline of\r\n                            investing larger amounts.\r\n      </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"part\">\r\n                        <h2>Claim tax benefits </h2>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            Investors who are starting out their journey in the world of investment, can look at\r\n                            ELSS to not only help achieve financial goals but also save tax.

There are three asset classes available i.e.\r\n                          equity, debt and cash. We should decide a ratio in which we assign our capital to\r\n        these asset classes.</p>\r\n                        <p>When we are in our 30s or in a preceding age range, we should pick up the most\r\n                          aggressive funds and watch them grow over 30 years. There is no one single size that\r\n                          fits everyone, but by the time we are in our 30s, we start saving money. At that\r\n                          time, we have 30 years for the goal like retirement. Hence we can hold on to the\r\n        investment for a long period of time. </p>\r\n                        <p>When we reach say 45 years, we can switch to equity-oriented balanced funds.</p>\r\n                        <p>When we retire, we should opt for safety of capital, which gives us our monthly\r\n        return. </p>\r\n                        <p>However, the above can vary from person to person. But in today’s world with\r\n                          inflation eating into our hard-earned money, we have to be more judicious about our\r\n        investments.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"part\">\r\n                        <h2>According to Risk</h2>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            An expert once said that one should only take as much risk so as still manage a\r\n        sound sleep at night.

These schemes\r\n                          are less\r\n                          volatile than pure equity funds because of the mixed portfolio. The debt investments\r\n                          provide stability in times of volatility. These mutual funds are suitable for new\r\n                          stock\r\n        investors and conservative equity investors.</p>\r\n                        <p>Large-cap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by\r\n                          their market capitalisation. These companies are considered safe to invest because\r\n                          they are likely to be well-established players and leaders in their respective\r\n                          filed and can proliferate best returns. This is the reason why large-cap funds are\r\n                          considered suitable for\r\n                          conservative equity investors. These funds are likely to offer modest returns as\r\n        they carry relatively less risk.</p>\r\n                        <p>If you can deal with risk, invest higher percentage in small and mid cap or sector\r\n        funds.</p>\r\n                        <p>Midcap funds invest mostly in medium-sized companies. These companies can be risky as\r\n                          they may or may not realise their full potential. However, if they succeed, they\r\n                          will become large companies and investors will be rewarded handsomely. Investors\r\n        with high risk appetite should bet on these funds.</p>\r\n                        <p>Smallcap funds invest in small companies. These companies can be extremely risky and\r\n                          thus exhibit volatile performance over a shorter period of time, as there will be\r\n                          very little information about them available in the public domain. However, they can\r\n                          also offer phenomenal returns. They are suitable only for investors with a very high\r\n        risk appetite.</p>\r\n                        <p>Sector funds invest mostly in a particular sector or along the lines of a defined\r\n                          theme. Since the investments are concentrated on a single sector or theme, sector\r\n                          funds are considered extremely risky. It is very important to time the entry into\r\n                          and exit from them as the fortunes of sectors changing in different cycles in the\r\n                          economy. They are meant for investors with an intimate knowledge about a particular\r\n        sector.

Objective of Short\r\n                            term goals is safety over growth and liquidity. Mutual funds have various categories\r\n                            of schemes that cater to short term investments which can help you in meeting your\r\n                            short term goals like planning for holidays or wedding or buying electronic gadgets\r\n                            or house renovation to name a few.\r\n      </p>\r\n                        <p>For very short term goals and for emergency fund you have to invest in liquid funds\r\n                          or ultra short term funds as emergency fund is a corpus where you would need funds\r\n                          immediately as and when emergency arises and hence liquidity and minimal exit load\r\n                          are critical drivers. These are funds that invest primarily into money market or\r\n                          short tenor liquid instruments but provide the flexibility to redeem the funds at\r\n        short notice with minimal or no exit load.</p>\r\n                        <p>If the goal is 3 years away, we can invest in an income fund or dynamic bond fund.\r\n                          These funds typically invest in corporate paper and are able to generate higher\r\n        returns than bank fixed deposits in most cases.</p>\r\n                        <h3>For medium term goals</h3>\r\n                        <p>Some top of mind Medium term goals are saving for a down payment to buy a house or\r\n        spending on one’s wedding or purchasing a car. </p>\r\n                        <p>In order to achieve medium term goals, we can invest in balanced fund.

Since the time frame for these goals is minimum 8-10 years, you can invest\r\n                          in equity funds. One can start by investing aggressive small cap and large cap\r\n                          equity funds. These funds have higher exposure to equity and hence could have\r\n                          volatile returns. While investing for long term we are looking for capital\r\n                          appreciation and hence can take risk volatility of returns on our capital.

Since we are nearing the time which requires our intervention on saving tax, it\r\n      is apt for you to know about the newly introduced sections where you can save tax.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"being_small\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h3>Tax-exempted medical premium increased from INR 30,000 to INR 50,000 u/s 80 D, Income\r\n      Tax Act, 1961</h3>\r\n                    <p>This is applicable for senior citizens of 60 years of age.

However, for the current financial year the limit has been raised to\r\n                      INR 50,000.

Looking at the above study of past trends of the Elections years, investors must start investing immediately to get the higher returns in next 18-24 months’ time horizon. Very significantly, instead of putting the lumpsum investment, one should opt for Systematic Transfer Plan (STP) preferably maximum in 3 to 6 installments to generate the better returns making best use of prevailing volatility in the Equity market.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"helps_inculcate_financial_discipline\">\r\n                    <hgroup>\r\n                        <h3> <strong>Suggested Focused Equity schemes for STP:</strong> </h3>\r\n                    </hgroup>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    </p><ul>\r\n                        <li> <p><strong>ICICI Pru Bluechip Fund:&nbsp;</strong>\r\n                        </p><ul>\r\n                                <li>A diversified Large-cap equity fund, managed in a Value / Contrarian style</li>\r\n                                <li>Fund generally has a well-diversified portfolio  with a layer of volatility management using stock &amp; index derivatives\r\n          </li>\r\n                                <li>The fund manager follows a value style of investing and is open to investing in out of favor stocks or sectors that hold promise of visibility of earnings in the long term\r\n          </li>\r\n                                <li>One of the most consistent performers in the large cap funds category, the fund tends to vary the sector allocation to generate alpha.

These schemes do not have a fixed maturity\r\n                      period. Investors can conveniently buy and sell units at Net Asset Value (NAV) which are\r\n      declared on a daily basis. The key feature of open-end schemes is liquidity.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Close-ended Fund/ Scheme</h3>\r\n                    <p>A close-ended fund or scheme has a maturity period that is clearly specified. When the\r\n                      scheme is launched, the fund is open for subscription only during a prescribed period.\r\n                      Thereafter investors can buy or sell the units of the scheme on the stock exchanges as\r\n                      they would do in case of any other listed security. To enable investors to exit, some\r\n                      close-ended funds offer an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through\r\n      periodic repurchase at NAV related prices.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h3>Based on objective Receiving Creating a corpus or Regular Income – Growth or Dividend\r\n    </h3>\r\n                    <p>One’s investment objective may also determine the type of fund which one would have to\r\n      shortlist:</p>\r\n                    <h3>Growth Funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for\r\n                      investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans (albeit\r\n      with possibly high returns) and can wait over a period of time.</p>\r\n                    <p>This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause\r\n                      adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady\r\n      returns.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Dividend Funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>For investors who seek to earn a regular income, dividend funds are best suited. However,\r\n                      there is a difference in the dividends that are offered by stocks and by mutual funds.\r\n                      In the case of stocks, dividends are earnings generated by a company (usually profits)\r\n                      that are distributed amongst shareholders. This is besides the appreciation in share\r\n                      price of a stock. Whereas in the case of a dividend mutual fund, a small chunk of the\r\n                      units or shares of the mutual fund are sold at a price which is higher than the purchase\r\n                      price to earn dividends. The dividend pay-outs can be monthly, quarterly or yearly.\r\n      Depending on the fund, the dividend can also be re-invested.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h2>Based on Risk Appetite</h2>\r\n                    <p>Risk appetite is also a function of investment goals. A retired citizen who is investing\r\n                      for regular monthly income would have a different risk appetite from someone who is\r\n      investing with horizon of a decade for buying a house.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Index funds mirror an index.</h3>\r\n                    <p>These funds will purchase stocks in the same proportion in which they comprise an index.\r\n                      For instance, if a particular stock forms 2% of an index which is being followed by a\r\n                      mutual fund, the mutual fund will invest 2% of its investible corpus in that particular\r\n                      stock. The performance of an index fund will more or less mimic that of the index which\r\n                      it follows except for a difference that would creep up, known as tracking error.\r\n                      Expenses incurred by an index fund are lower as compared to other types of mutual funds.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    <p><b>Balanced funds are also known as hybrid funds. These are primarily of two types:\r\n        Equity Oriented Funds and Debt Oriented Funds.</b></p>\r\n                    <h3>Equity-oriented funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Equity-oriented funds invest a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent of the corpus) and\r\n                      debt. These funds offer attractive returns over a longer period of time but returns can\r\n                      be highly volatile in the short term. These funds are suitable for investors who can\r\n      deal with the risk and have a longer investment horizon.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Debt-oriented funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Debt-oriented funds are low risk funds that primarily invest in highly rated corporate\r\n                      bonds and stable government bonds. They offer steady returns and are suitable for\r\n      conservative investors.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Equity Linked Savings Schemes</h3>\r\n                    <p>Equity Linked Savings Schemes make it possible for investors to claim uptoRs 1.5 lakhs as\r\n                      tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act while creating a corpus! However,\r\n                      an investor cannot withdraw money before 3 years as this scheme has a mandatory lock in\r\n      period.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Largecap Funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Largecap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by their\r\n                      market capitalisation. These companies are well established and have immense\r\n                      credibility. They are most likely to be among the top names in their respective sector.\r\n                      Although there is no fixed nomenclature, a company whose market cap is more than Rs\r\n                      10,000 crores is considered to be a large cap company in India. Conservative and risk\r\n                      averse investors can start investing in large cap funds. These funds carry less risk and\r\n      offer modest returns.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Midcap funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Midcap funds invest mostly in medium-sized companies. Their rise and fall, both could\r\n                      occur at a scorching space. But these companies may successfully grow over a period of\r\n                      time and provide handsome returns to investors. Investors with the ability to take\r\n      considerable risks should bet on these funds.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Smallcap funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Smallcap funds invest in small companies. Investing in these companies over short term\r\n                      could be perilous unless backed by substantial research and credible experience.\r\n                      However, they can also offer phenomenal return over a longer duration of time. They are\r\n      appropriate only for investors with a significantly high-risk appetite.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Sector funds</h3>\r\n                    <p>Sector funds invest only in businesses which are operating in a particular sector. For\r\n                      example, a Pharma themed fund will only invest in Pharmaceutical companies. As\r\n                      investments are directed towards a specific sector or theme, sector funds are considered\r\n                      extremely risky. Timing the entry into and exit from these sectoral funds is imperative\r\n                      as some of these sectors are cyclical. They are meant for investors with deep knowledge\r\n                      about a specific sector. It is advisable for investors to only take marginal positions\r\n      in these funds.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n                    <p>As the idiosyncrasies of different individuals vary, everyone has a different set of\r\n                      goals to meet.

Sudden changes in the management team and their approach could\r\n                          affect returns on investments a great deal. Hence, it is a prerequisite to ensure\r\n                          transparency and corporate governance for leading a positive impact on a firm’s share\r\n      price. </p>\r\n                        <h3>VOLATILITY RISK</h3>\r\n                        <p>An equity fund invests at most 80% of their assets in equity and equity related\r\n                          instruments and hence, the performance of an equity fund is directly proportional to the\r\n                          performance of companies. Changes in government, SEBI, and RBI policies can directly\r\n                          impact the value of the stocks of a company either in a positive or negative way.\r\n                          Generally, large-cap mutual funds are less susceptible to volatility in comparison with\r\n                          small-cap and mid-cap mutual funds. A diversified equity fund is comparatively less\r\n      liable to get affected by volatility or sudden changes.</p>\r\n                        <h3>LIQUIDITY RISK</h3>\r\n                        <p>It is a common knowledge that investing in mutual funds for a longer period of time\r\n                          always has higher chances of yielding a profit on investments. But sometimes due to the\r\n                          lock-in period and unavailability of buyers, the liquidity risk increases. Also, you\r\n                          cannot do anything during the lock-in period. So, the best way to prevent liquidity risk\r\n      is by keeping a diversified portfolio and selecting mutual funds wisely.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                        <h2>Investment Risks Posed by Debt Funds</h2>\r\n                        <p>The following are some investment risks posed by debt funds:</p>\r\n                        <h3>INFLATION RISK</h3>\r\n                        <p>Inflation risk is also known as the purchasing power risk. Tools like bonds and money\r\n                          market have a fixed coupon rate. Inflation mitigates the coupon rate earnings that the\r\n                          debt fund is bound to receive. Inflation has detrimental effects on the potential\r\n                          returns of an investor. On the contrary, lower levels of inflation proliferate the value\r\n      of debt fund investments.</p>\r\n                        <h3>INTEREST RATE RISK</h3>\r\n                        <p>The price of a debt fund tool is indirectly proportional to the rate of interest. Bonds\r\n                          are less productive and their values hit rock-bottom when interest rates shoot up and\r\n                          vice versa. The debt funds that have a shorter lock-in period are less susceptible to\r\n      interest rate risk as compared to the debt funds that hit maturity late.</p>\r\n                        <h3>CREDIT RISK</h3>\r\n                        <p>Debt funds allocate funds mostly in government securities, corporate bonds, certificates\r\n                          of deposit (CDs), commercial papers, etc. There are different credit rating agencies\r\n                          such as CRISIL, ICRA, Fitch, and Brickworks, that are responsible for rating debt funds\r\n                          on the basis of their credit value. A higher rated debt fund offers maximum credit\r\n      value, whereas a lower rated debt fund offers the lowest credit value.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n                        <p> Investing in mutual funds can put your money to work and allow you to garner a large\r\n                          amount of wealth in the long run.

The funds stick to their set ratio for generating income as well\r\n                          as\r\n      capital appreciation.<br />These funds are recommended by many for first time\r\n                                                                                              investors as\r\n                                                                                              they cater to those that\r\n      have very little appetite for&nbsp;risk but are seeking capital appreciation.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                        <h2>Why invest in Balanced Funds?</h2>\r\n                        <p>The main gain of investing in these funds is diversification of your investment\r\n                          portfolio. The fund manager re-balances the fund as per requirements and handles the\r\n                          asset allocations. It suits well for investors looking for gains from the stock\r\n                          markets but are not prepared for the volatility in the markets. Experts opine that\r\n                          all kinds of investors should ideally allocate some portion of their investments\r\n      into balanced funds.<br />\r\n                            The appeal also lies in the fact that these funds are more or less insular to sudden\r\n      changes in sentiment, panics, or rapid changing mood in markets.<br />\r\n                            It does not obviously promise the kind of returns one would expect from, say,\r\n                            diversified equity funds, however, for the more conservative and prudent investor,\r\n                            balanced funds are a healthy long term growth prospect with usually a spike free\r\n                            progression graph.\r\n                            Balanced Funds, among other things, also offer the benefit of risk adjusted returns.\r\n                            Hybrid funds are good for people who are looking to invest a small portion of their\r\n                            income on a regular basis. Another major pro for such investors is that it allows\r\n                            one to withdraw systematically meanwhile taking care of the right asset allocations.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                        <h2>What are the risks while investing in balanced funds?</h2>\r\n                        <p>As with all mutual funds, they are not completely safe from risk.

This decision power lies with the fund manager,\r\n                          rightly so in most cases, as they are professionally trained and experienced to\r\n                          manage such investments unlike many investors who have little to no knowledge about\r\n      it.<br />\r\n                            As an investor, when you hold only a particular class of funds, you can\r\n                            move some of\r\n                            the funds into others as part of a diversification for various purposes like taxes,\r\n                            wealth management etc. On the other hand, you cannot do the same in case of balanced\r\n                            funds as the same mutual fund is the owner of both asset classes—equity and debt.\r\n    </p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div className=\"pb-4\">\r\n                        <h2>How do I choose the right balanced fund?</h2>\r\n                        <p>It is paramount for an investor to choose a fund that caters to their long-term goals.\r\n                          When\r\n                          you consider choosing the fund among the options in front of you, history doesn’t hold\r\n                          prime\r\n                          position.

However, it is critical that senior citizens not only pay close attention to their health but also the cost of health related expenses. However seniors do tend to exhibit reluctance about buying health insurance. They feel it is not a worthwhile investment and instead would be waste of money.</p>\r\n                    <h2> Here are 10 reasons why it is important for senior citizens to buy health insurance</h2>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h3> Life expectancy is increasing </h3>\r\n                    <p>The rise in life expectancy among Indians has been substantial. From 58 years in 1990 to 68.3 years in 2015, the increase has been remarkable. Over the next few years, this will only keep increasing. However, this trend also brings with it, the importance of having a relatively incident free old age. Over a period of time, one may discover that there is a post retirement life of close to 25 years that lies ahead. The simple fact of probability dictates that this would certainly be filled up few hospital visits on account of accidents or illnesses. Therefore it is imperative that senior citizens don’t view health insurance as an expense and rather look at it as a viable investment of protection.  </p>\r\n                    <h3>Be Independent </h3>\r\n                    <p>Earlier retired parents would feel that their children are completely responsible for their well-being during old age. Joint families were the norm and some or the other family member would be at the beck and call of senior citizens. However times have changed. Proliferation of nuclear families, immigration of children to other cities and countries for better opportunities and general change in culture is resulting in several retired parents living by themselves. And many of them welcome this change too as they prefer their independence. Therefore it makes perfect sense for them to continue being independent by investing in a bulletproof health insurance policy and not depend on anyone else for footing medical expenses.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Don't break nest egg </h3>\r\n                    <p>Senior citizens are most likely to have a nest egg to depend on during their post retirement years. This may be a combination of their savings, provident fund and gratuity. This nest egg enables senior citizens to live independently without worrying about securing their own needs. They can also use this nest egg to purchase gifts for their loved ones. Apart from one’s house, which would be most probably owned by retired seniors, the nest egg is a reflection of one’s dedicated and industrious career. However, a couple of instances of hospitalization can not only cause a huge dent to one’s nest egg but may also obliterate it. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Peace of mind for family members</h3>\r\n                    <p>Family members of seniors who get hospitalized not only worry about their well-being but also turn tensed about impending medical bills. Sometimes this also leads to temporary discords in family relationships. This may result in bickering about which family members has to pay how much to foot medical bills. Owning health insurance brings about substantial peace of mind to both seniors and their family members. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Legacy/Inheritance for family members does not get impacted </h3>\r\n                    <p>Seniors in India prefer their family members to inherit their wealth after passing on. Inheritance could include both real estate as well as financial holdings. In the absence of health insurance, these financial holdings could be wiped out in case of prolonged and multiple hospitalization. A senior may feel immensely let down and may carry the burden or unwanted stress and disappointment in not being able to do anything for the next generation’s aspirations.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Some ailments could be chronic and therefore may need repeated hospitalization </h3>\r\n                    <p>Ailments such as diabetes, lung diseases, hypertension etc are chronic and therefore would require repeated hospitalization. In fact 65% of seniors suffer from chronic ailments. Around 33% suffer from atleast 2 chronic ailments simultaneously.  Even a single visit to a hospital could invite significant expenses. Added to this would be the regular outflow of money towards medicines and regular check-ups which cost Rs 500 and Rs 600 respectively. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Treatment for critical illnesses would be expensive </h3>\r\n                    <p>Average cost of breast cancer treatment has grown from Rs 1.5 lakh in 2000 to Rs 6 lakh as of 2015. For all other types of cancer treatment, rise in treatment costs has inflated by 300% to 400% over 15 years. This also causes immense economic burden as many families are forced to borrow at prohibitive interest rates. In fact, six cycles of chemotherapy can cost as high as Rs 20 lakh. Disturbingly 10 lakh new cases of cancer are reported in India every year as per World Health Organization (WHO). These numbers are alarming</p>\r\n                    <h3>No compromise on the quality of treatment </h3>\r\n                    <p>Our government spends hardly 1.2% of the GDP on healthcare. This can be compared to the Draft National Health Policy 2015 released by the government which advocates spending of at least 2.5% on public healthcare. Low budgets and and lack of transparency lead to shortage of vital equipment, overworked staff and general mismanagement. This keeps most of us away from public hospitals. A leading consulting firm released a report which highlighted the difference in cost between branded and unbranded hospitals. The cost was difference was almost a lakh. Thanks to fine print almost every aspect of the service offered by a hospital, right from the space where one is wheeled to before x-ray to mattresses, is chargeable. In fact, one shouldn’t be surprised about spending at least Rs 40,000 for any procedure in a private hospital. Most families prefer private hospitals as the state of public hospitals in our country is not up to the mark. But this results in higher hospitalization expenses. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Being included in family floater plan makes it expensive </h3>\r\n                    <p>Seniors also end up finding themselves as a part of a family floater plan. Inclusion of senior citizens makes the family floater plan expensive. In fact, including an individual above the age of 45 in a family floater plan isn’t recommended. Chances of a senior suffering from a serious medical ailment is higher and the entire sum insured may get exhausted while offering coverage to just the senior’s medical expenses. The No Claim Bonus clause offered by a family floater plan may also get impacted if the senior requires frequent hospitalization. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Higher Tax Benefit</h3>\r\n                    <p>Who doesn’t love to save taxes? Especially senior citizens who may have to pay tax if they are receiving income through their deposits or pension or both. Some of them may also be employed and therefore would be required to pay tax. However, they can claim additional tax deduction on payment of health insurance premium thanks to a new announcement made in budget 2018. Earlier seniors could only claim up to Rs 30,000 for tax deduction under Section 80D of the Income Tax Act. Now, this amount has been increased to Rs 50,000. Therefore even if health insurance premium seem to be expensive, they offer attractive tax benefits.</p>\r\n                    <p>By purchasing individual health insurance policies for themselves, senior citizens are not only safeguarding their own interests but also ensuring the well-being of their family members. At the outset it may seem expensive to purchase individual health insurance policies as seniors, but even a single bout of hospitalization would make one feel that investing in a comprehensive health insurance policy was certainly worth the while.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"Post retirement life is considered to be full of relaxation, pursuit of hobbies and meeting old friends.\"\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        category: 'Insurance', displayName: 'Insurance',\r\n        \"id\": \"11-health-insurance-early-age\",\r\n        orderSequence: 5, readingTime: 4,\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"11 Important Reasons to Buy Health Insurance at an Early Age\",\r\n            imgLink: '/hi-img-02.png',\r\n            detailImgLink: '/hi-img-lg-02.png',\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-02.png\",\r\n            banner: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-banner-02.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-09T08:38:51+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": (<article className=\"blog text-justify \">\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <p>The best time to invest in an asset is when it is bound to grow with time, and not when it is shrinking in value. Therefore, the best time to purchase a health insurance for you was yesterday. You should invest in your health while you are still young and healthy. Remember the return on an investment in health insurance will be seen over your entire life and not just the first year you get the cover for. Here are 10 reasons to convince you to buy insurance right away:</p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2> Premium is cheaper  </h2>\r\n                    <p>The premium amount that an insurer charges to cover your health expenses depends on your current health status and age. Further, the younger you are, more are the number of premiums the insurer expects you to pay over the duration of your life – and therefore can ask for a lower premium per year compared to someone older. This means you would be paying smaller premiums not just at the start of the policy but throughout the duration of your policy with the insurer. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Waiting period is shorter</h3>\r\n                    <p>Many health insurance policies today have a waiting period at the start of the policy. Only accidents are covered during this period and the actual health cover only kicks in at the end of this waiting period. Further, if you have any pre-existing conditions – they are typically only covered after a waiting period. This waiting period varies from illness to illness and policy to policy. When you start early, the overall waiting period is generally shorter. On top of that, as a health individual you will not have to worry about waiting period for pre-existing conditions at all. You will get the full coverage as soon as the generic waiting period is completed.</p>\r\n                    <h3>No age related upper limit to deal with</h3>\r\n                    <p>Most of the health insurance products have an upper limit on the entry age. This means your options get limited as you grow older. Further, most health insurance schemes provide coverage without conducting a medical examination if the insured is under the age of 40 years – this changes from policy to policy, but to get the most comprehensive coverage at a reasonable price you should purchase health insurance at a young age. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Greater Coverage</h3>\r\n                    <p>As a young person, you will get a greater coverage at the same price when compared to an older person. The reason is simple: the older you are the higher is the chance that you will need to spend on healthcare. This includes expense on day care procedures, treatment for vector borne diseases, other OPD expenses and maternity benefits. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Accumulating no claim bonus</h3>\r\n                    <p>Most insurers provide a no claim bonus for every consecutive year you do not claim your insurance. This bonus varies from 5% to 100% of your sum assured. As a young person, there is little chance that you would file a claim, and therefore you will be able to accumulate a large no claim bonus for use when you truly need the assistance. On the other hand, if you decide to take out an insurance policy only later in life, you may not get the advantage of this bonus – and will have to pay a higher premium for similar coverage.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Several options to choose from</h3>\r\n                    <p>As a young one, you have many more options available when choosing an insurance provider. You can pick and choose the add-on covers that best match your health profile. This becomes more and more difficult as you age as some benefits have a low entry age and others will be refused by the insurer based on any medical history that you may already have. </p>\r\n                    <h3>You are comparatively healthier</h3>\r\n                    <p>As we have pointed out earlier, the best time to buy your health insurance is when you are comparatively healthy. This way you avoid any inconvenience arising from a waiting period, and have to pay a lower premium as you are at low risk when it comes to medical expenditure. With a good policy, you will also get free annual check-ups to proactively work towards keeping yourself healthy and managing your health better.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Lower chances of rejection</h3>\r\n                    <p>When you are younger, the chances of an insurance company rejecting your proposal are almost nil. The chance goes higher with your age and as your medical history builds up. Remember that insurers do not want to cover people who are bound to make a claim before they have paid up enough premiums to justify the claim from a financial standpoint for the insurer. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Life-long renewal</h3>\r\n                    <p>Most policies today offer coverage till the age of 65, there are a few that may go up to 70 years of age. But most senior citizens either have to opt for a specialized senior citizen policy or go without any health coverage. An easy way to avoid this eventuality is to invest in health insurance early – this will allow you to get lifelong renewal from most of the insurers. The extended coverage can prove a boon in the older age, allowing you to enjoy the best available medical facilities when you need them the most.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Absence of pre existing conditions: </h3>\r\n                    <p>As noted earlier, most health insurance policies impose a waiting period before they cover pre-existing conditions. In some cases, the insurer may exclude certain pre-existing conditions from coverage completely. Therefore, it makes sense to get a health cover before you develop any illnesses. This allows for a more comprehensive coverage, and access to better healthcare when needed.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Bursting myths about health insurance</h3>\r\n                    <p>There are many myths about health insurance that you should not fall for when buying health insurance. The most dangerous among them is that you do not need a health insurance if you are young and health. You may be healthy now, but illnesses do not come with a forewarning. You must be prepared for the worst at all times. Another myth is that the health coverage starts from the day you buy an insurance policy and therefore you can buy it when you are more likely to contact an illness. This is untrue as most policies have a built-in waiting period. It follows that the best time to buy insurance is when you are healthy and the waiting period has no impact on your medical expenses. A related myth is that if you have a medical cover, all your healthcare expenses will be paid for by the insurer. This is untrue as most policies have sub-limits on expenses that are covered under different heads. These limits are lower the later you purchase a policy. </p>\r\n                    <p>Lastly, do not buy the cheapest policy. It may not provide you with a comprehensive coverage. Remember that the cost or premium that you will have to pay is just one factor among many that help you decide on the right policy. The most important thing is that your anticipated health expenses are covered and you or your family does not have to run from pillar to post putting together the finances when an emergency strikes.</p>\r\n                    <p>Get a health insurance policy while you are young and enjoy a lifetime of benefits.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"The best time to invest in an asset is when it is bound to grow with time, and not when it is shrinking in value. \"\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        category: 'Insurance', displayName: 'Insurance',\r\n        \"id\": \"11-things-to-know-before-buying-health-insurance\",\r\n        orderSequence: 10, readingTime: 6,\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"11 Things to Know Before Buying Health Insurance\",\r\n            imgLink: '/hi-img-03.png',\r\n            detailImgLink: '/hi-img-lg-03.png',\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-02.png\",\r\n            banner: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-banner-02.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-09T08:38:51+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": (<article className=\"blog text-justify \">\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <p>Buying health insurance is among the most important decisions that you will make in your adult life. But sometimes it may feel a bit daunting to pick the right insurance out of the many available in the market. Calculating the correct coverage that you need may feel like advanced calculus - but it need not be. Here are 11 things to keep in mind before buying health insurance that will make the decision simplified.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2>Thumb rule for calculating insurance that you need</h2>\r\n                    <p>Let us start by answering the most obvious question: how much health insurance do you need? Think of it like getting a vaccination: you should get the mandatory ones, and you should get the ones for diseases you may catch when travelling someplace before your trip – rest you can ignore. For example, you don’t that costly vaccine for that rare strain of influenza that is spreading fast in Africa. Similarly, your health insurance should provide sufficient cover for common causes for medical expenditure, but you will have to worry about that rare disease only if you actually catch it. This also means that you should look at your family’s medical history to find out what diseases you are susceptible to – diabetes in the family? Make sure your health insurance covers it.</p>\r\n                    <p>This may feel too daunting. The thumb rule is to use your income as the base to calculate the amount of cover you should get – your health cover should be equal to at least half your annual income. If that seems too low. It should at least be sufficient to pay for a coronary artery bypass in a hospital of your choice.</p>\r\n                    <p>Given the rising inflation, the group insurance cover you get from your employer may not cover all medical expenses to a sufficient degree - like post-hospitalization charges and room rent may have a cap. Therefore, you should consider getting add-on insurances to provide sufficient coverage for all manner of expenses. You should also consider buying a top-up insurance. This will cost you less than a regular insurance as it will have a large cut-off and will kick in only after you have exhausted your primary health insurance cover.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Whether you should buy individual plan or family floater plan</h3>\r\n                    <p>A family floater provides coverage towards the medical expenses of your entire family, so that you do not have to worry about getting individual covers for all members. Remember that not all your family members will need medical attention at the same time – so instead of getting a 5 lakh cover for each member separately, getting a 7 lakh cover for the whole family may suffice. Further, a family floater provides for a larger coverage at lower cost.</p>\r\n                    <p>That said, if some of your family members have a high health risk – for example, if your spouse is a regular smoker – it is better to get an individual cover for them. So, a family floater is best suited for young couples with kids not yet in the workforce. It is best to get an individual insurance for family members with high health risk as they may end up using 100% of the sum-assured leaving other members practically without insurance. </p>\r\n\r\n                    <h3>Check for pre-existing illnesses and make a list</h3>\r\n                    <p>A few years back, a friend of mine had applied for a health insurance for her mother. Her mother had no illnesses or disorders at that time, so she left the column for preexisting illnesses empty and declared the absence of such conditions.</p>\r\n                    <p>Unfortunately, her mother was in a road accident about a year later. But the claim filed by her was rejected by the insurer! The reason listed, as you may have guessed, was ‘non-declaration of pre-existing illness’. It turned out that her mother was taking medication for blood pressure when she had applied for the cover. Even though her pressure was normal at that time, any condition that she has previously had treated or diagnosed with or has been treated for is considered pre-existing. </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        To avoid any miscommunication, and subsequent rejection of claim in the hour of need, you should list down your complete medical history and pre-existing illnesses. This list should include the following:\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li>Medical history of illness: History of heart attack, gestational diabetes, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Hospitalization history: Hospitalization in case of angioplasty, kidney stone, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Signs: Increase in sugar level, obesity, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Symptoms: Having brain fog, feeling sweaty, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Medication for any disease or illness: Hypertension medication, diabetes medication, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Skin disorder: Psoriasis, Vitiligo, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Major accidental injury: Head injury, having prosthetic limb, etc.</li>\r\n                        <li>Diagnosed illnesses: Diabetes, hypertension, etc. that you have or had before applying for a policy.</li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <p>It is unlikely that your application will be rejected due to your medical history. In the most likely scenario, some of your pre-existing conditions will get coverage after a waiting period. In some cases, the insurer may charge a higher premium to cover certain conditions. Nevertheless, it is better than having your claim denied and even being sued for insurance fraud. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Waiting Period</h3>\r\n                    <p>One of the persistent myths about health insurance is that the coverage starts as soon as one purchases a policy. Typically, the policy has a waiting period at the start of the first year of coverage during which only accidents are covered. Further, an additional waiting period may be stipulated for pre-existing conditions and specialized covers like maternity benefits and critical illness cover. </p>\r\n                    <p>Always pay attention to the waiting periods and only buy insurance where you are comfortable with the duration of these. If you feel that the waiting period for some of the illnesses is too long, you can ask the insurer to shorten it but at a substantially higher premium.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Pre/Post Hospitalization expenses should be covered</h3>\r\n                    <p>When one gets ill, hospitalization expenses are just one aspect of the medical expenses incurred. There are also expenses incurred for various tests that may have to be conducted pre-hospitalization, medicine expenses, consultation charges both pre-and post-hospitalization, and other post-hospitalization expenses when you are still recuperating – all these add up to a significant amount. It is important that these expenses are also provided for by your insurer. In most cases, medicine costs can far outweigh the hospitalization charges – and therefore make sure that your policy does not exclude these from coverage.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Maternity benefits</h3>\r\n                    <p>Given the rising average age of women at first pregnancy and the rising caesarian to normal delivery, it is important to get a maternity cover when planning to have a child. Typically, maternity benefits are bought as an add-on to standard health cover. These come with a waiting period ranging from 9 months to 6 years, and therefore it is important to invest in one as soon as possible. While the coverage varies with the insurer and the policy opted for, at the minimum it should cover:</p>\r\n                    <ol>\r\n                        <li>\r\n                            Hospitalization expenses, pre-hospitalization expenses for 30 days and post-hospitalization expenses for 60 days.\r\n                        </li>\r\n                        <li>Delivery expenses</li>\r\n                        <li>Vaccination costs for the new born</li>\r\n                        <li>Ambulance charges </li>\r\n                        <li>Post-natal expenses depending on the type of delivery – caesarian delivery would typically involve higher expenses</li>\r\n                        <li>Health insurance for the new born and</li>\r\n                        <li>Cover for pregnancy related emergencies</li>\r\n                    </ol>\r\n                    <h3>Free medical check up</h3>\r\n                    <p>Prevention is always better than cure, and towards this you should get an annual health checkup. Most insurers cover a preventive check-up during the policy period. Further, claiming this does not impact your no claim bonus. So, make sure your insurance policy has a provision for the same, and don’t forget to take advantage of the same.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Life time renewal</h3>\r\n                    <p>Most health insurance policies stop coverage after the insured reaches the age of 60-65 years. But if you get an insurance cover when young, you can get the added advantage of life time renewal, that is you can keep renewing the cover regardless of your age. This can prove to be a boon given the higher life expectancy and escalating medical expenses as one ages. Therefore, make sure your policy has the clause foe life time renewal; even if you have to pay a slightly higher premium for it – a small investment today will pay back rich dividends over your lifetime.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Cumulative bonus</h3>\r\n                    <p>Most health insurance plans provide a cumulative no claim bonus. This is like a reward for maintaining a good health. The quantum of the bonus varies from 5% to 100% of the sum assured, and typically 4-5 years of no claim result in doubling for the coverage. Make sure that your policy has a provision for the same, and be willing to make small out-of-pocket expenses to allow this bonus to build up over the years.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Claim Process</h3>\r\n                    <p>Before you buy an insurance policy, make sure you understand the claim process well – both for cashless and reimbursement claim. Check the claim settlement ratio of the insurer – that is the percentage of claims submitted that the insurer honors. The higher the CSR, better are the chances that your claim will not be rejected. This is important as the moment of truth for an insurance policy is when the claim is made.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Check whether your preferred hospital is there in the TPA network</h3>\r\n                    <p>Every insurer has a network of hospitals where they provide cashless treatment to the insured. This means that the insured need not spend a single paisa from her pocket as the insurer will directly pay the bills to the hospital. In the time of emergency, you do not want to be rushed across the city just because the network hospital is there. Make sure that sufficient number of hospitals in your locality are part of the network, and the hospital that you prefer getting treatment at is part of the network as well.</p>\r\n                    <p>With these points in mind, you will be able to pick the right health insurance policy from the plethora of options available. Remember that some of the advantages that you get from a health insurance policy get restricted as you age, therefore get a cover as soon as you can. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"Post retirement life is considered to be full of relaxation, pursuit of hobbies and meeting old friends.\"\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        category: 'Insurance', displayName: 'Insurance',\r\n        \"id\": \"importance-of-critical-illness-plan\",\r\n        orderSequence: 20, readingTime: 3,\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"Importance of Critical Illness Plan\",\r\n            imgLink: '/hi-img-04.png',\r\n            detailImgLink: '/hi-img-lg-04.png',\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-02.png\",\r\n            banner: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-banner-02.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-09T08:38:51+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": (<article className=\"blog text-justify \">\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <p>We have often read or heard about adding a critical illness component in our health insurance plan. Most people wonder whether it makes sense to include this add on in one’s health insurance policy. In this article we will read about its importance and benefits so that one can take an informed decision.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2>What is a critical illness cover?</h2>\r\n                    <p>Critical illness is a condition that threatens life. The cover which protects against it is known as a critical illness cover. It is also known as dread disease insurance. It is either offered as a rider or as an add-on to one’s health insurance policy or can be purchased as a standalone plan. Experts recommend on purchasing the latter as it would offer several benefits as compared to a rider and is quite comprehensive. Stroke, heart attack, paralysis, cancer, organ transplant, blindness, terminal illnesses are some of the conditions covered by it. However, the complete list of conditions that are covered can vary from insurer to insurer. The cover is paid immediately after diagnosis of a critical illness condition. The sum assured is tax free.</p>\r\n                    <h3>The need for critical illness cover</h3>\r\n                    <p>Let us look at publicly available data. Number of Indians dying due to cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, cancer, liver diseases and kidney diseases are 24 lakhs, 11.6 lakhs, 5.56 lakhs, 2.16 lakhs and 2 lakhs respectively. The average cost of treatment for the same are Rs 3.5 lakhs, Rs 20 lakhs, Rs 10 lakhs, Rs 18 lakhs and Rs 4 lakhs respectively. Incidents in India due to heart diseases and diabetes are predicted to double and cancer cases are expected to increase by 25%. An open heart surgery in a respected hospital could cost anywhere between Rs 6 lakhs to Rs 8 lakhs.</p>\r\n                    <p>These are massive numbers. An individual suffering from any of these conditions may not only feel tremendous mental stress but one’s family could be affected too. The financial hardships caused due to the spending on treatment could be tremendous.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Benefits of a critical illness plan</h3>\r\n                    <h2>Payment is offered as lumpsum </h2>\r\n                    <p>– Once critical illness is diagnosed, the entire cover is offered as a lumpsum (after the survival period of the same is in force). This is a significant benefit for the holder of the critical illness insurance policy. It plays a vital role in ensuring that both the affected individual as well as his family can only focus on the treatment rather than running around to arrange for financial assistance.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Premiums remain the same </h2>\r\n                    <p>Premium paid for health insurance policies may change over the years depending on your age during the time of policy renewal. However, when it comes to critical illness, the premium remains the same.  This is a massive advantage offered by a critical illness rider.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Peace of mind </h2>\r\n                    <p>When it comes to diagnosis of critical illness, one cannot underestimate the presence of a lumpsum amount that can be immediately dispatched for spending on treatments and other particulars. Once there is peace of mind, the amount of stress and worry reduce considerably. </p>\r\n                    <h2>Finances are not impacted </h2>\r\n                    <p>Spending on treatment of critical illness is a leading cause of financial distress for middle class individuals and their families.  </p>\r\n                    <h2>Don’t need to compromise on the treatment </h2>\r\n                    <p>Due to lack of financial resources, one may be tempted to compromise on the quality of hospital or treatments offered to save money. This could have both short and long term consequences. </p>\r\n                    <h2>Aspirations of family members need not take a backseat</h2>\r\n                    <p>Due to the huge spending on treatment for critical illness, one’s savings could wiped out. One would have wanted to use these savings for fulfilling aspirations of one’s family members such as for higher education or for a holiday or for buying a new house or for marriage. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Keep an eye out for</h3>\r\n                    <p>However, one cannot take critical illness coverage for granted. One also needs to keep an eye for certain important aspects of purchasing a critical illness cover. These include:</p>\r\n                    <h2>Survival period </h2>\r\n                    <p>Some insurers may demand a survival period clause which could be between 30 and more than 30 days. According to this clause, the insured individual would have to survive for the pre-decided period post getting diagnosed with a critical illness. The lumpsum would be released post survival period.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Scrutinize the fine print </h2>\r\n                    <p>Go through the fine print carefully. If you aren’t good with details, make sure that a dependable family member or friend who is adept at spotting the little details, inspects your policy. Understand what the exclusions are. Check whether these exclusions along with your details are in line with what you had expected.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Number of illnesses covered </h2>\r\n                    <p>As written earlier in the article, different insurers may provide coverage for different number of critical illnesses. Therefore before buying, one should check the entire list of critical illnesses covered by an insurer.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Credibility of insurer </h2>\r\n                    <p>– It is also a good idea to ask around and understand what has been the claim settlement ratio offered by the insurer. One can also research about how smooth is the claim settlement process.\t</p>\r\n                    <h2>Pre-existing critical illnesses may not be covered </h2>\r\n                    <p>Insurers may end up offering critical illness plans to individuals suffering from pre-existing diseases as long as they aren’t related to the critical illnesses covered by the policy.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Disclose everything </h2>\r\n                    <p>– Insurers have made medical examinations compulsory. Inspite of this, certain individuals may end up withholding medical facts. It is important that complete disclosure about one’s medical history, past ailments and hospitalization is done.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n                    <p>In our country – cases of diabetes, heart diseases and cancer are growing substantially. These diseases are no longer the prerogative of those who are senior in age. In fact, 40% of heart patients in India are between the age of 25 and 35. Therefore it is imperative that all members in a family end up purchasing a critical illness policy with adequate coverage and comprehensive benefits.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"We have often read or heard about adding a critical illness component in our health insurance plan. \"\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        category: 'Insurance', displayName: 'Insurance',\r\n        \"id\": \"term-insurance-for-seniors\",\r\n        orderSequence: 9, readingTime: 3,\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"Should Seniors Purchase Term Insurance\",\r\n            imgLink: '/hi-img-05.png',\r\n            detailImgLink: '/hi-img-lg-05.png',\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-02.png\",\r\n            banner: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-banner-02.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-09T08:38:51+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": (<article className=\"blog text-justify \">\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <p>The prevailing wisdom has always been that term insurance is a financial product suitable for those who are in the beginning or middle stages of their careers. As one grows older and closer to retirement, the need for a term insurance policy diminishes. Most insurers also focus on customers between the age of 30 and 50 when it comes to educating about and selling term insurance. </p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2> Offerings for seniors </h2>\r\n                    <p>  However, insurers are recognizing the need to provide seniors with customized products. These term insurance products are for those between the age of 50 and 85. Insurers understand that although it is important to start engaging with young customers, products can also be tailed for an older audience which may even have a robust investible surplus to pay for premiums.</p>\r\n                    <h3> Why would seniors purchase term insurance? </h3>\r\n                    <h2>Liabilities or debt </h2>\r\n                    <p> There could be pending debt or liabilities that an individual may need to pay off and wouldn’t want the burden to be on the shoulders of dependents in the event that the individual passes away. One’s dependents may also have some loans to be settled. In either of these cases, a term insurance policy would come in handy. This is because if the individual passes away during the term, the death benefit could help pay off all the loans. </p>\r\n                    <h2>Still working </h2>\r\n                    <p> One may be a senior citizen but still working. This could be either due to earn additional income to keep financial insecurity at bay or there could be dependents. In certain cases when the income of the individual makes up a significant contribution to his/her family’s income, then the unfortunate demise of such an individual could have a huge impact on the family’s financial well-being as well as future aspirations. </p>\r\n                    <h2>Kids are Dependent </h2>\r\n                    <p> One assumes that senior citizens would most probably have financially independent children. This may not always be the case. One scenario could be that the individual married late and therefore is a parent to a child who is still studying. Another scenario could be either due to personal or professional setbacks, the offspring of the individual is not earning any income and is therefore dependent on the parent for the near future. It is quite possible that the offspring has a child and therefore the individual has to also take care of the grandchild. Another situation could be that the senior is forced to work due to having a large family where in spite of other family members working, the income isn’t enough. Due to such circumstances, the parent would be forced to think about the well-being of his or her offspring.  </p>\r\n                    <h2>Spouse is dependent </h2>\r\n                    <p> Life could land one in a situation where the only other person that matters is the spouse. Either there are no children or relatives or they have moved on. Or the individual and the spouse don’t wish to depend on their children or relatives. In such a case, if the working spouse passes away the dependent spouse will have to depend on a child or relative for a steady source of income. Instead, the working spouse could purchase a term insurance policy and include the spouse as a nominee. </p>\r\n                    <h2>Leave a legacy or inheritance </h2>\r\n                    <p>As one grows older, the need to bequeath a legacy or a healthy inheritance to children or grandchildren beckons. Sometimes, there may not be enough to bequeath or the number of prospective inheritors may be more than accounted for. In such a case, a term insurance policy could also become an instrument that enables one to pass on a robust financial inheritance.   </p>\r\n                    <h2>Setting taxes or legal fees </h2>\r\n                    <p>If you have property to pass on to your dependents, the same might attract property taxes and legal fees if your dependents decide to sell it. These could be either short term or long term capital gain taxes. The death benefit which they would receive could help in paying off these taxes or even legal fees that might be incurred.  </p>\r\n                    <h3> Things to look out for </h3>\r\n                    <p> There are a few important aspects to consider for seniors when they are buying term insurance: </p>\r\n                    <h2>Smoking and non-smoking </h2>\r\n                    <p>Term Cover is available for smokers till they turn 75. The premium that an older person will have to pay for term insurance would be higher if he is a smoker as compared to if he isn’t. Therefore the temptation to hide this fact might be strong. This may have an adverse impact if your insurer finds out later, especially when the claim has been filed. Therefore it is advisable to disclose that one is a smoker.</p>\r\n                    <h2>Make dependents aware about claim process </h2>\r\n                    <p>If the dependent is not financially savvy or isn’t literate, then the process of claiming death benefit could be a tedious one. The financial dependent could be made aware of the same by explaining all the steps in an easy to understand manner. </p>\r\n                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n                    <p>Purchasing term insurance at an older age includes high premiums, increased number of exclusions, pre-existing illnesses etc. Yet, if it makes sense to purchase term insurance for the well-being of one’s dependents, then one should go ahead and buy a term policy. However, nothing beats the advantage of buying term insurance when one is still young as premiums are cheap and the protection term is high.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"The prevailing wisdom has always been that term insurance is a financial product suitable for those who are in the beginning or middle stages of their careers.\"\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        category: 'Insurance', displayName: 'Insurance',\r\n        \"id\": \"9-reasons-to-buy-health-insurance\",\r\n        orderSequence: 15, readingTime: 6,\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"9 Reasons to Buy Health Insurance\",\r\n            imgLink: '/hi-img-06.png',\r\n            detailImgLink: '/hi-img-lg-06.png',\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-02.png\",\r\n            banner: \"https://onebajaj.capital/mutual-fund/resources/images/blog-img/mf-banner-02.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-09T08:38:51+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": (<article className=\"blog text-justify \">\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <p>As the popular adage goes “Health is Wealth”. To protect this wealth, it is important to start investing in it at an early age. Medical emergencies tend to come unannounced, and the chances of one happening have only risen in the last few decades. The medical advances mean that you are far more likely to survive an emergency, but that does not mean it will not leave you burdened with debt – if you are not prepared for it. The best way to prepare for a medical emergency is a health insurance.</p>\r\n                    <p>Still not convinced? Here are 9 reasons for you to buy health insurance right now!</p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2>Medical expenses are constantly increasing  </h2>\r\n                    <p>A 2018 study by Mercer Marsh Benefits found that the medical trend rate – that is the rate at which per capita medical expenses rise – will be double the inflation rate in India. Most experts believe that this relationship will hold for at least a few years to come. It was further noted that the rise in out-patient expenses which much steeper than the hospitalization expenses. An increase in the incidence of non-communicable diseases like heart disease, stroke, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, mental illness, diabetes, and kidney diseases is resulting in a subsequent increase in the employer-sponsored healthcare costs.   </p>\r\n                    <p>This means any savings you had made towards your emergency funds may no more be sufficient even if they have been increasing at the general inflation rate. Having a health insurance can take away the pain of worrying about the rising health costs, as premiums rise at a much lower rate – if you purchase health insurance when young.  </p>\r\n                    <h3> No need to compromise on Medicare quality </h3>\r\n                    <p> Rising medical costs have resulted in a financing gap for people who depend on their own savings to meet medical expenses. This means that they either have to borrow – from informal channels like family or formal channels like banks and money lenders – or have to compromise on Medicare quality. When households have no option but to use public health facilities, it has been observed that they are stuck in a waiting queue, have to deal with low quality care and even have to make under-the-table payments. A health insurance policy is a way to avoid all this and get the best quality healthcare. Further, insurance companies are large buyers of healthcare giving them an ability to negotiate on prices that individuals lack, especially because on an information asymmetry between caregivers and patients.  </p>\r\n                    <h3> Reduces blow to one's finances </h3>\r\n                    <p> According to the latest report from the Public Health Foundation of India, released on June 6, 2018, 55 million Indians were driven into poverty due to out of pocket expenses on healthcare in 2017. To put this in perspective, this is more than the population of countries like South Korea, Spain or Kenya. Out of these, 38 million i.e. 69% were impoverished because of paying on medicine alone. According to 2011-12 figures provided by National Sample Survey, over 80% of Indians make out of pocket payments for healthcare needs – buying a health insurance will ensure that you are not one of them and the likelihood of your other savings and finances being blown away in an emergency are reduced drastically. </p>\r\n                    <h3> Family is protected and offered peace of mind </h3>\r\n                    <p> Remember that when you get sick, it is not just you who is affected. If the medical emergency is such that you have to be hospitalized, you may also be losing income. You family depends on you to meet at least some of their needs. You may be building up some savings for your kid’s higher education, or you may have made investments for your daughter’s wedding – in case of emergency, the family will have to dip into these for funds when you do not have a health cover. A health insurance will ensure your family is protects, some income substitution is provided for and they can deal with the emotional stress without also having to worry about the finances.  </p>\r\n                    <h3>  Tax benefit</h3>\r\n                    <p> The government of India offers tax benefits on the purchase of health insurance to encourage individuals to invest in the same. Under Section 80D of the income tax act, amount that an individual or a Hindu United Family pays to keep an insurance policy in force, i.e. health insurance premium can be deducted from the taxable income. This deduction also includes any amount (up to a maximum of Rs. 5,000) spent on preventive health checkups for yourself, your spouse or children in case of individuals or any member of the HUF.  </p>\r\n                    <p>The deduction allowed for any individual under the age of 60years is Rs. 25,000. For individuals over 60 years, the limit is increased to Rs. 50,000 considering the higher anticipated cost of healthcare. A further deduction is allowed for health insurance premiums paid for your parents’ insurance. The cap on this is Rs. 25,000 for parents under the age of 60 years and Rs. 50,000 for parents over the age of 60 years. </p>\r\n                    <p>The total permitted deduction under section 80D is Rs. 1,00,000 for individuals and Rs. 50,000 for HUF.</p>\r\n                    <h3>  Insurance offered by employer may be inadequate</h3>\r\n                    <p> Many individuals avoid investing in a health insurance as their employer provides a group health cover as well. This may not be a good strategy as the insurance provided by the employer may not be adequate. As a rule of thumb, your health cover should be at least 9 times your monthly income. If the employer health insurance is less than this – you must invest in additional health insurance. Further, pay attention to deductible, co-payment and exclusion clauses in your employer provided insurance – if these feel excessive, opt for additional cover to make sure that you do not have to pay out of pocket. </p>\r\n                    <h3> During a sabbatical from work or in between jobs insurance offered by employer would not be valid </h3>\r\n                    <p>   If you are banking on the health insurance provided by your employer to help you in the time of need, remember that this insurance is only valid till the time you are in employment. This leaves you exposed to a financial risk when one is between jobs or on a sabbatical. You may not be planning to switch jobs, but no job comes with a 100% guarantee – the company may choose to downsize or may even be locked down because of circumstances out of your control. A health crisis at the same time may cripple your family’s finances. It is important to be prepared for all eventualities – and investing in a health insurance is a great way of doing so.</p>\r\n                    <h3> Environment and Lifestyle constantly exposes us to risks </h3>\r\n                    <p>   Increasingly sedentary lifestyle coupled with the deteriorating environment exposes each of us to increased health risks compared to even a few years back. A recent study conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the Public Health Foundation of India analyzed 79 health risk factors contributing to loss of health as well as death found that lifestyle diseases have become the top killer in India. High blood pressure, high blood sugar and the pollution in household air are responsible for 7.8%, 5.2% and 4.7% of total health loss in the country. Tobacco smoking of all kinds, alcohol usage, high blood cholesterol and outside air pollution are other major culprits in the deteriorating health profile across India. The latest report from CSE found that more than 61% of all deaths in India can be directly attributed to lifestyle or non-communicable diseases. </p>\r\n                    <p>It has been observed that savings to combat health expenses have generally not kept pace with the higher probability of a health incident. Therefore, it is advisable to buy a health insurance to cover the rising risk.</p>\r\n                    <h3> Rise of critical illness ailment </h3>\r\n                    <p>  Today you are much more likely to get a critical illness then were your parents at your age. That said, the good news is that you are much more likely to survive your brush with such an illness, given the advances made by the medical science. But the fact remains that high cost of such treatment can push one to penury. Doctors around India have sad tales to share of patients who chose to abandon treatment rather than make their families toil in poverty.  </p>\r\n                    <p>Take, for example, cancer that can be linked to over 7% of deaths in India. The cost of treatment can run into many lakhs as a single vial of Herceptin – arguably the most effective drug against breast cancer – costs Rs. 75,000 to Rs. 1,00,000. A patient may need anywhere between 6 to 17 vials during the course of the treatment. Drugs administered to cancer patients cost anywhere in the range of Rs. 25,000 to Rs. 50,000 a cycle and a patient may need 10 cycles per course. This is not all – along with the high treatment costs and hospitalization charges, the family also has to deal with the loss of income. Let us not forget that any loans the patient would have taken will continue to demand their EMIs regardless of the individual’s medical condition. </p>\r\n                    <p>Therefore, it is essential that we are prepared for such eventualities. The best way forward is to invest in a health insurance policy that provides a critical illness cover. Before buying the insurance, make sure to check the list of illnesses covered and ensure that the illnesses you maybe more susceptible to are covered. </p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"As the popular adage goes “Health is Wealth”.

A credit score is primarily based on a credit report, information typically sourced from credit bureaus. In India there are 4 credit information companies licensed to operate namely CIBIL, Experian, Equifax, CRIF High Mark. The most popular of all is CIBIL credit score. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Why Credit score is important for Personal Loan?</h3>\r\n                    <p>When applying for a personal loan, credit score is the first thing banks and financial institutions generally check for. Credit score generally depends on the repayments of personal loan, home loans, car loans, credit card bills. If all the repayments are done in a timely manner and no pending dues are left then automatically it will translate into a good Credit score, and would increase over time.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Banks and financial institutions generally don’t provide loans to applicants having low credit score or even they do they charge a very high interest rate.\r\n</p>\r\n                    <p>It can also impact your ROI (rate of interest). If you have a good credit score, then you can always bargain with the Bank/Financial institution for the rate of interest on your loan. You could save thousands of rupees in repayments of loan if you have a good credit score.</p>\r\n                    <p>You can also have access to better rewards credit cards with lower interest rates and you might even be offered checking accounts, investment accounts, and credit cards with signing bonuses. Having access to these financial deals may help you better manage your resources in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <h3>What are the factors causing a low Credit Score?</h3>\r\n                    <p>The following are the factors causing a low Credit score:</p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Untimely re-payments of loans/ credit card bills.</li>\r\n                        <li>High utilization of Credit limits.</li>\r\n                        <li>Multiple rejected credit cards and loans.</li>\r\n                        <li>No credit history at all.</li>\r\n                        <li>Multiple loans at same time.</li>\r\n                        <li>Settling unsecured loans with banks/financial institutions at the lower amount than the dues.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <p>In conclusion your creditworthiness is quite important to the lenders. If you have good credit score you are automatically benefited from it; but if your credit score is low, lenders may question your ability to pay what you owe. Improving your creditworthiness takes time, but it’s worth the effort.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"As the popular adage goes “Health is Wealth”.

Below are the list of points compiles for you to easy approval of your personal loan.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2>Meet the eligibility criteria  </h2>\r\n                    <p>It is the first and foremost rule that goes without saying for applying for a personal loan. You should always check for the eligibility criteria of the financial institution you are applying loan from. Generally, borrowers apply for the loan amount they are not eligible for and hence let to rejection of their loan. Hence as a rule of hand before applying for a personal loan just check the eligibility criteria of that financial institution and apply only if you meet every eligibility criterion. Ensure you meet eligibility criteria in every aspect such as documents, income certificates, credit reports, tax returns, etc.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Have a good credit score:</h3>\r\n                    <p>Credit score plays a major role in financial institutions deciding the amount to be lent and interest rate to be charged for the money lent. Also, it also helps them decide whether to approve/reject your loan application. Credit score is generally calculated on various criteria like 35% payment history, 30% amount owed, 15% length of history, 10% new credit, 10% types of credit used. The range for the credit score lies between <b>350 - 900</b>. A good credit score is anything above 700 and there are high chances of rejection of your personal loan application if the score is below 550. Hence it is always suggested to not apply for the personal loan directly, if you have a low credit score, but take time to improve your credit score and and then apply for personal loan.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Don’t apply for new loan while repaying a previous one.</h3>\r\n                    <p>As a rule do not apply for another loan if you already have any loan in your name. Financial institutions generally reject your personal loan application if there is already a loan against your name. This is because financial institutions see this as another burden your financial condition and your inability to repay the second loan. They generally see how feasible it is for you to pay the loan to mitigate their own risk of defaulting the loan.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Be reasonable when deciding your loan amount.</h3>\r\n                    <p>Before providing you the loan financial companies tend to check your ability to repay the loan, they refer to your current income to ascertain your repayment ability. Hence one should not apply outrageously high loan amount as financial institutions would reject your loan application. You should always check with the institution if you would be able to pay the borrowed amount in the stipulated time with the interest rate applicable and then only apply for that amount.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Don’t Send Out Multiple Loan Applications:</h3>\r\n                    <p>Generally, applicants, tend to apply for a personal loan to multiple financial institutions as they think it would improve their chances of approval of the loan. But it is completely opposite, financial companies tend to think that the chances of this applicant taking loan from that institution is quite less. Hence do not apply for multiple financial institutions and just stick to one.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n                    <p>In conclusion to the above points your loan application should be self-explanatory and should have all the check boxes ticked as required by these financial institutions. Following these steps would increase your chances of personal loan approval manifold times. Apply to Financial Institutions patiently, and, look for a deal with a low-interest rate.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"As the popular adage goes “Health is Wealth”.

You may pay the loan amount earlier (pre-payment) than the stipulated time.

On the other hand, opting for shorter tenure, you pay higher EMI’s for shorter period; but also lower the Interest rates.

Despite being it, such an important factor applicant does not take credit score quite seriously.

This may not be listed in the eligibility criteria or their website, but lenders generally investigate the income statement of the applicants.

A credit limit is assigned to you by your bank as per your spending capacity. A credit limit is like a loan. However instead of giving you the whole loan in one go, banks allows you to use your limit as per your need.</p>\r\n                    <h3>How Do Credit Cards Work</h3>\r\n                    <p>There is a whole process behind a credit card transaction. When you make a purchase using your credit card, the merchant's credit card terminal makes a query to your credit card provider, if the card is valid and if it have the required spending limit remaining, answering the query your credit card provider response the merchant’s credit card terminal, if the transaction is approved or not. </p>\r\n                    <p>At every spend you make by your credit card, your credit limit goes down by that particular amount. For example- if you have a credit limit of Rs. 50,000 and you have spent Rs.10,000 on a product, your credit limit will reduce to Rs. 40,000 and you’ll owe Rs. 10,000 to bank as an outstanding balance which you need to pay at the end of your billing cycle.</p>\r\n                    <p>The basic difference between a credit card and a personal loan is that your credit limit will be available again onec you pay the outstanding balance due on your card. In the example mentioned above., if you paid back the Rs.10,000 that you owed, you'd have Rs. 50,000 of available credit again.</p>\r\n                    <p>The Major difference between a credit card and a loan is that you can use the credit limit of the card in packets as per your requirement and also n times by paying off your outstanding balance, where as in loan, bank offers you a certain amount in one go, which you can use only once.</p>\r\n                    <h3>What are late payment charges?</h3>\r\n                    <p>There is a certain period of time before the interest charged on your credit card out standing balance. This time is called the grace period, this period varies as per the bank. Usually it is of 20 to 25 days. If you do not pay your credit card outstanding amount within the grace period, then a particular interest is charged on the amount due on your credit card.</p>\r\n                    <p>The interest rate is the annual rate you pay for using your credit limit. Interest rates depends on few factors like market interest rates, your credit history, and the credit card you own. If you have a good history of paying back your credit card bills then you’ll be charged lower interest rate.</p>\r\n                    <p>If you want to avoid interest you have to pay your credit card bill before the grace period get over, though the credit card providers do not want you pay the whole outstanding balance in one go, you can also pay the minimum amount against your credit card bill. Paying only the minimum is the slowest and most expensive way to pay off your credit card balance.</p>\r\n                    <p>It is most important to pay at least minimum amount of your credit card bill in order to maintain a good credit score and to avoid late payment charges. </p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"Many of us are known to credit cards even before using it.

Similarly if you find out that your credit card bill due date was 1st of the month and it is already 3rd. Or you just checked that a late fee has been assessed in your credit card statement for a payment that you made late. This usually happen with many of us. So, if we act quickly then this damage can be controlled.</p>\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div id=\"alpha\" className=\"pb-4 scrollarticle\">\r\n                    <h2>Make the Payment Quickly</h2>\r\n                    <p>If you missed a credit card payment due date you should make the payment as soon as possible. If you’ll pay the payment quickly after missing your due date then it will prevent the credit card provider to report your late payment to the credit bureaus,which can lower down your credit score. Credit card providers usually report a late payment after atleast 30 days. So you need to make sure that you payment before it becomes 30-40 days late.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Request Credit Card Provider for Leniency</h3>\r\n                    <p>Firstly you should check your account if a late fee has been applied,some card issuers impose a late fee immediately after the due date. Many providers are not very strict in keeping the late fee charges intact unless and until you are habitual of payment the credit card. Sometimes banks refuse to ignore the late payment charges. take it as a lesson learned, pay the fee, and send your payment on time for future payments.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Can You Protect Your Interest Rate</h3>\r\n                    <p>Credit Card Providers can’t impose a penalty rate increase unless you’re at least 60 days delinquent on your payment  and unless you have a promotional rate. The bad news, however, is that missing a payment (despite the reason or degree of lateness) could cause you to forfeit any promotional rate. A credit card provider who’s willing to waive a late fee might not be as lenient when it comes to your promotional rate.</p>\r\n                    <h3>Remember When Your Bills Are Due</h3>\r\n                    <p>If you have missed your the due date of your credit card bill once or twice then there is not much to worry, but if you are missing it every month then you should develop a system of reminders. For example marking all your important dates of the month on a calender or setting up a reminder on your phone.You can set up reminders in your email or calendaring system. Or if you are a frequent credit card user you can also set up an automatic payment through your bank’s online bill pay to avoid missed payments. </p>\r\n\r\n                    <span> </span>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </article>\r\n            ),\r\n            \"field_description\": \"To maintain a good credit score it is very important to pay all your credit card bills on time.
